## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run with npm (Recommended)

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   - The server will open automatically at **http://localhost:3000**
   - If not, go to: **http://localhost:3000/START-HERE.html**
   - All pages are served from localhost (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/index.html`)

**Available scripts:**
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server with live reload (opens START-HERE.html)
- `npm start` — Same as dev
- `npm run serve` — Start server without auto-opening browser

### Option 2: Open HTML files directly

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   cd EC-Lab
   ```

2. **Open any HTML file directly in your browser**
   - For Admin view: Open `index.html`
   - For Student view: Open `student-dashboard.html`
   - For QR Request Form: Open `student-request.html`

3. **No build process required** - These are static HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript

### Navigation Flow

#### Admin Workflow:
1. `index.html` → Dashboard overview
2. `admin-requests.html` → Review pending requests
3. Click "Approve" → Auto-redirects to `print-checklist.html`
4. Print checklist for laboratory technician
5. `inventory.html` or `equipment.html` → Manage inventory

#### Student Workflow:
1. Scan QR code in laboratory → Opens `student-request.html`
2. Fill out multi-step form (Student Info → Request Details → Items → Review)
3. Submit → Receive reference number
4. `student-dashboard.html` → Track request status
